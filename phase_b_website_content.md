Phase B: Business Architecture Document: OnEdge AI Intelligence Service 

Purpose 
This document outlines the Business Architecture for OnEdge's Edge Intelligence Service, as part of TOGAF Phase B. It translates the Architecture Vision (Phase A) into a structured framework, detailing business capabilities, processes, organizational structure, value streams, and stakeholder interactions to deliver a decentralized AI platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The architecture supports the vision of providing real-time, affordable, secure, and sustainable AI intelligence through ONEDGE Micro-Factories, NeoCortex AI, Starlink connectivity, and KOIN cryptocurrency, addressing SMB needs in healthcare, manufacturing, finance, retail, and IoT. 

Scope 
The Business Architecture focuses on: 

Business Capabilities: Core and supporting capabilities enabling the platform's goals (e.g., real-time intelligence, affordability). 
Business Processes: Key processes for platform delivery, including AI inference, payment processing, and compliance. 
Organization Structure: Roles, responsibilities, and governance for internal and external stakeholders. 
Value Streams: End-to-end flows delivering value to SMBs, from onboarding to insight delivery. 
Stakeholder Interactions: Refined stakeholder mapping and engagement strategies. 
Diagrams: Canvas models visualizing capabilities, processes, and value streams.
